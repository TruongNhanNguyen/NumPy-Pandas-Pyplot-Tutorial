# NumPy-Pandas-Matplotlib.Pyplot Tutorial

This is my short and quick tutorial for learning 3 basic Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas and Pyplot(Matplotlib.Pyplot).

## About NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

I am currently using [![numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/NumPy-1.19.5-000?logo=numpy&logoColor=blue&labelColor=white)](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).

### Install

If you have't installed `pip` already, run this command to install `pip` on your computer.

```sh
py -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

Then upgrade `pip` to the latest version:

```sh
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Using `pip` to install NumPy

```sh
pip install numpy
```

You can find out more about NumPy installing [here](https://numpy.org/install/)

## About Pandas

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

I am currenly using [![pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-1.3.4-000000?logo=pandas&logoColor=purple&labelColor=white)](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

Install Pandas using `pip`

```sh
pip install pandas
```

## About Pyplot

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

I am currently using [![matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-3.4.3-000000?labelColor=orange)](https://matplotlib.org/)

Install using `pip`

```sh
pip install matplotlib
```
